# AI Running Training Plan Generator

A scientific, evidence-based training plan generator that follows the principles outlined in the `.cursorrules` file, including periodization, progressive overload, and injury prevention.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Features

- **Scientific Foundation**: Based on peer-reviewed research and coaching principles
- **80/20 Polarized Training**: Follows the proven 80% easy, 20% hard training model
- **Periodization**: Implements Base ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Peak ‚Üí Taper progression
- **Individual Customization**: Adapts to experience level, target distance, and preferences
- **Injury Prevention**: Built-in 10% rule and recovery week scheduling
- **Multiple Distances**: Supports 1 Mile, 5K, 10K, Half Marathon, and Marathon training

## üß¨ Scientific Principles

### Training Zones & Intensity Distribution
- **Zone 1-2 (80% of training)**: Aerobic base development, fat oxidation
- **Zone 4-5 (20% of training)**: VO2 max and lactate threshold development
- **Zone 3 (minimized)**: The "gray zone" - too hard for easy days, too easy for hard days

### Periodization Model
- **Base Phase**: Aerobic foundation, musculoskeletal durability
- **Build Phase**: Increasing training stress, race-specific preparation
- **Peak Phase**: Race-specific training, performance optimization
- **Taper Phase**: Volume reduction, performance peaking

### Injury Prevention
- **10% Rule**: Maximum weekly mileage increase
- **Recovery Weeks**: Scheduled every 3-5 weeks based on experience level
- **Progressive Overload**: Systematic training stress progression
- **Strength Training**: Integrated 2-3 times per week

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd RunningCoachAI

# No external dependencies required!
python main.py
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from datetime import date
from src.models import RunnerProfile, RaceDistance, ExperienceLevel
from src.plan_generator import TrainingPlanGenerator
from src.formatter import TrainingPlanFormatter

# Create runner profile
profile = RunnerProfile(
    experience_level=ExperienceLevel.INTERMEDIATE,
    target_distance=RaceDistance.HALF_MARATHON,
    peak_race_date=date(2024, 6, 15),
    weekly_mileage_target=35,
    days_per_week=5
)

# Generate training plan
generator = TrainingPlanGenerator()
plan = generator.generate_plan(profile)

# Format and display
formatter = TrainingPlanFormatter()
print(formatter.format_plan_summary(plan))
```

### Interactive Mode

```bash
python main.py
```

Follow the prompts to create your personalized training plan.

### Example Plans

```bash
python main.py examples
```

View example training plans for different distances and experience levels.

## üìä Supported Distances

| Distance | Training Weeks | Key Focus | Energy System |
|----------|----------------|-----------|---------------|
| 1 Mile | 8-12 weeks | Neuromuscular power | 85% aerobic, 15% anaerobic |
| 5K | 10-16 weeks | VO2 max development | 92.5% aerobic, 7.5% anaerobic |
| 10K | 12-18 weeks | Lactate threshold | 96% aerobic, 4% anaerobic |
| Half Marathon | 14-20 weeks | Aerobic threshold | 97.5% aerobic, 2.5% anaerobic |
| Marathon | 16-24 weeks | Metabolic efficiency | 98.5% aerobic, 1.5% anaerobic |

## üéØ Experience Level Adjustments

### Beginner (< 1 year running)
- **Mileage Increase**: 5% weekly (conservative)
- **Max Mileage**: 80% of target
- **Recovery Weeks**: Every 3rd week
- **Base Phase**: +2 weeks extension

### Intermediate (1-3 years running)
- **Mileage Increase**: 8% weekly
- **Max Mileage**: 90% of target
- **Recovery Weeks**: Every 4th week
- **Base Phase**: +1 week extension

### Advanced (3+ years running)
- **Mileage Increase**: 10% weekly
- **Max Mileage**: 100% of target
- **Recovery Weeks**: Every 5th week
- **Base Phase**: Standard duration

## üìã Training Plan Structure

### Weekly Schedule
- **Long Run**: 15-35% of weekly mileage (distance-dependent)
- **Easy Runs**: 60-80% of weekly mileage
- **Quality Sessions**: 20% of weekly mileage (tempo, intervals, hills)
- **Rest Days**: Integrated based on training days preference

### Workout Types
- **Easy Run**: Conversational pace, Zone 2
- **Long Run**: Steady pace, Zone 2, practice nutrition
- **Tempo Run**: Lactate threshold pace, Zone 4
- **Intervals**: VO2 max development, Zone 5
- **Strides**: Neuromuscular coordination, Zone 4
- **Hills**: Strength and form, Zone 4
- **Race Pace**: Specific pace practice, Zone 4
- **Recovery**: Very easy pace, Zone 1
- **Rest**: Complete rest or light activity

## üí™ Strength Training Integration

### Recommended Frequency
- **Beginner**: 2 days per week
- **Intermediate**: 2 days per week
- **Advanced**: 3 days per week

### Focus Areas
- Hip abductors and extensors
- Core stability
- Single-leg exercises
- Posterior chain strengthening

### Timing
- On non-running days
- After easy runs
- Before quality sessions (light activation)

## üîÑ Recovery & Adaptation

### Recovery Guidelines
- **Sleep**: 8+ hours per night
- **Nutrition**: Post-workout within 30-60 minutes
- **Active Recovery**: Light movement preferred over complete rest
- **Monitoring**: Track resting heart rate, sleep quality, energy levels

### Adaptation Timeline
- **Cardiovascular**: 1-4 weeks
- **Mitochondrial**: 4-8 weeks
- **Metabolic**: 8-12 weeks
- **Supercompensation**: 7-day cycle
